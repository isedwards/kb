I always use Windows instances in VirtualBox for less than 30 days of uptime, but often a lot of time passes between uses. This is usually okay, because I take a snapshot of the original setup that I can return to and then I can use one of the 3 rearms (each giving an additional 30 days).

`This article <https://itfunk.wordpress.com/2013/01/09/resetting-rearm-count-in-windows-7/>`_ talks about reseting the rearms, which could be useful for testing.
