= Installing on Ubuntu desktop image

* General > Advanced: Shared Clipboard Bidirectional

```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y dkms build-essential linux-headers-generic linux-headers-$(uname -r)
sudo mount /dev/cdrom /media/cdrom
sudo /media/cdrom/VBoxLinuxAdditions.run
```

= Installing on Ubuntu server image

Before the final step of running `VBoxLinuxAdditions.run`, either:
 
 * Install xserver (you can then use a tool like https://sourceforge.net/projects/xming/[Xming] (XLaunch) with http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/download.html[PuTTY]): `sudo apt-get install xserver-xorg`
 * Run the final step without X11 support:
   `sudo /media/cdrom/VBoxLinuxAdditions.run --nox11`

To copy and paste into the console running in the VirtualBox window you may want to install GPM.

*Update*: Unfortunately the GPM clipboard does not sync with the X11 clipboard, so copy and paste still does not work. One of the solutions here may work: http://superuser.com/questions/451039

= Shared folders

Attempting to access the shared folders will give the error `Permission denied`
```
sudo adduser your_username vboxsf
sudo reboot
```

= Errors

http://superuser.com/a/768845[VT-x/AMD-V hardware acceleration is not available on your system]

VT-x/AMD-V support gets disabled for VirtualBox if you have Hyper-V installed. Disable Hyper-V from an elevated command prompt by typing:

`dism.exe /Online /Disable-Feature:Microsoft-Hyper-V`
