Docker creates a bridge named docker0 by default. Both the docker host and the docker containers have an IP address on that bridge, e.g. `docker run --network="bridge"  # (default)`

On the Docker host, type `sudo ip addr show docker0` for details.

If you use `--network="host"` in your docker run command, then 127.0.0.1 in your docker container [will point to your docker host](https://stackoverflow.com/a/24326540).
