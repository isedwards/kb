* Turn off automatic updates
* Leave desktop background unless recording screencasts (always reverts to theirs?)
* Consider downloading IE11 to avoid website message about unsupported IE browser
* Use Right-ctrl/Home for VirtualBox menu (turn mouse integration on and off if menu/status bars are off)
* ShareX - use shift/print-screen (first time selects capture area, second starts and shows green dashed boundary, third stops recording)

Rearm
-----

I always use Windows instances in VirtualBox for less than 30 days of uptime, but often a lot of time passes between uses. This is usually okay, because I take a snapshot of the original setup that I can return to and then I can use one of the 3 rearms (each giving an additional 30 days).

`This article <https://itfunk.wordpress.com/2013/01/09/resetting-rearm-count-in-windows-7/>`_ talks about reseting the rearms, which could be useful for testing.
