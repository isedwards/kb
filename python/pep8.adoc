= PEP8

== Maximum line length

* 72 characters for docstring and block comments
* 79 characters for single line comments and code

(Begin comments with a capital letter where approproate, omit full stops for single sentence/single line comments)

Where it would not be sensible to split a line, try to isolate the unsplitable section on a line on its own,
and add `# noqa` (no quality assurance) to ensure PEP8 tests pass, e.g.

```
INITIAL_PASS = \
'pkbef3_sha256$1600$e839FwWInhRB45boewo9zkx8z2aAsCsVBoUNYnoeCefJegeDGEdg23fdw='  # noqa
```

```

```

NOTE: In general - urls don't belong in code (e.g. including links to stackoverflow!), the exception being valid links in inline docs
