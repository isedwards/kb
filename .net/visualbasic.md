Block comments
--------------

* <kbd>Ctrl + K, C</kbd> to comment
* <kbd>Ctrl + K, U</kbd> to uncomment

Undo
----

Default shortcuts:

* Ctrl-Z is not Undo - instead this is redo
* Ctrl-Y is not Redo - wrong again, this is "Yank", it deletes the current line (with the added side effect of clearing the redo history)
