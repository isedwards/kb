PerfWatson
----------
`PerfWatson <https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=VisualStudioProductTeam.VisualStudioPerfWatson>`_ is installed by default in the latests versions of Visual Studio. It sometimes causes delays when installing extensions. I perfer to `disable it <http://stackoverflow.com/questions/42662444/how-to-disable-perfwatson2-exe-from-visual-studio-2017>`_ so that it's not using up memory monitoring VS all the time.
