Since the change to Vimeo plans in [August 2022](https://vimeo.com/blog/post/new-vimeo-plans/) it's no longer clear what is included in Vimeo Basic.

My latest videos say they need Vimeo Pro due to "duration is over 30 seconds". I've posted longer videos since Aug 2022, but those were uploaded
(mostly from loom - which has a 5 minute limit on their [free plan](https://www.loom.com/pricing)).
