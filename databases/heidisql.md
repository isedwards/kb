In HeidiSQL it's not immediately clear what each [key symbol](https://www.heidisql.com/forum.php?t=988) represents (because there are no tooltips on the symbols).

They indicate the index that is on each column:

- Yellow: Primary key
- Red: Unique key
- Green: Index
- Blue: Fulltext key
- Grey: No index
