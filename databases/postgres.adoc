== List databases and owners

    psql --list

or (from within psql)

    /l

== Backing up

== Dump and restore

https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.2/static/app-pgdump.html[pg_dump] can create text SQL or other archive formats.

Using the other archive formats has advantages:

* smaller file sizes (custom archive format is compressed by default)
* can use https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.2/static/app-pgrestore.html[pg_restore] command
* regardless of pg_dump options, can change with options like `--clear --no-owner`

Attempting to use pg_restore on text sql gives the following error:
----
    $ pg_restore --clean --no-owner --role=new_owner -d db_name db_name.dump
    pg_restore: [archiver] input file appears to be a text format dump. Please use psql.
----

Therefore, when using postgres, if we need to:

* change owner information on restore
* drop objects on restore

without editing the SQL we can consider using the archive formats and pg_restore.
