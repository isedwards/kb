## What I don't like

- Feel forced to use stage manager to group mindows to make it faster to navigate - but forces me to navigate using a pattern it chooses. However, if sharing an application windows and switch to another application, the shared window gets distorted into the stage manager shape...
- If you use Finder to move a folder to a location that already has a folder with the same name and you choose to proceed at the cancel/proceed warning - it doesn't merge the contents, it nukes whatever was already there...
- Cannot cut and paste files in Finder (have to make a "copy" and the "paste and move")
- There's no right-click to unzip files, instead a double click results in an unzip. Window's zip folders (originally by Dave Plumber) are more elegant
- The fn, control, option and command keys are inconsistent and often redundant. They could map to being similar to the control, alt and the windows keys but they seem more mixed up for historical reasons
- One thing that drives be crazy about macOS is not know which open applications (with a dot below them in mission control) currently have active windows vs no windows
  iOS drives me crazy how you can't close all app (you have to close one at a time). Also, is there no 'reset' on iOS? You have to shutdown?

Seems odd that the basic problems with Finder have never been addressed.
