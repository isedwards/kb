## What I don't like

- Feel forced to use stage manager to group mindows to make it faster to navigate - but forces me to navigate using a pattern it chooses. However, if sharing an application windows and switch to another application, the shared window gets distorted into the stage manager shape...
- If you use Finder to move a folder to a location that already has a folder with the same name and you choose to proceed at the cancel/proceed warning - it doesn't merge the contents, it nukes whatever was already there...
- Cannot cut and paste files in Finder (have to make a "copy" and the "paste and move"). They know this could be improved - but they choose not to.
- I can only have horizontal multiple desktops / workspaces? Linux windows managers have had a 2D grid forever - Allowing things like one row per project etc.
- There's no right-click to unzip files, instead a double click results in an unzip. Window's zip folders (originally by Dave Plumber) are more elegant
- The fn, control, option and command keys are inconsistent and often redundant. They could map to being similar to the control, alt and the windows keys but they seem more mixed up for historical reasons
- One thing that drives be crazy about macOS is not know which open applications (with a dot below them in mission control) currently have active windows vs no windows

Seems odd that the basic problems with Finder have never been addressed.


iOS drives me crazy how you can't close all apps (you have to close one at a time). You can't delete all alarms (you have to delete one at a time). It's like they don't trust you with that level of destructive power. Also, is there no 'reset' on iOS? You have to shutdown?

 
## What I do like

- Ability to screen capture a short video of a portion of the screen wasn't *built in* to other OSes (but probably is now)
- Track pad on MBP
