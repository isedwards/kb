Classic MacOS (Mac OS 9 and earlier versions) used CR (`\r`) but when Apple acquired NeXT in 1996 they based Mac OS X on NeXTSTEP and adopted the Unix convention of using LF (`\n`). Eventually OS X was renamed macOS for consistency with iOS, watchOS, and tvOS.

Like GNU Hurd, NeXTSTEP's XNU (X is Not Unix) kernel, which is still used in macOS, was based on The Mach microkernel which originated from a research project at Carnegie Mellon University in the 1980s (although Apple have implemented a hybrid kernel design). The macOS relationship to (free)BSD is similar to the Linux-GNU relationship where BSD and GNU respectively provided a collection of userland utilities, libraries, and software.

BSD licence is more permissive than GNU's GPL, but it only became completely free with the release of 386BSD (released in 1992) which had the proprietary Unix code replaced and eventually became FreeBSD and NetBSD.

Linux, BSD variants, DOS and early versions of Windows used monolithic kernels with Microsoft switching to a hybrid kernel, combining aspects of both monolithic and microkernel designs, from Windows NT (Window 10) onwards.
