Charges from flat in several hours on 'sealed battery' setting. When removing the battery from the car, disconnect the negative terminal first, followed by the positive.
Ensure the positive terminal does not touch anything metal (consider wrapping it in a cloth).

Reconnect positive first. You may notice a `small spark <https://www.mcmgarage.co.uk/2014/08/01/disconnecting-and-reconnecting-car-batteries/>`_ when connecting the negative lead.
