= Application settings and User settings

Dot NET projects have a capability for https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb397750(v=vs.110).aspx[persisting settings] (either globally for the application, or by user) across execution sessions.

The https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb397755(v=vs.110).aspx[crucial information] on how to make changes persist is hard to find:

== C#
Properties.Settings.Default.Save();

== VB.NET
My.Settings.Save()

Note that information stored is not encrypted and is stored in plain text. https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms171887.aspx[Connection strings stored in application settings] should not contain usernames and passwords, see https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/89211k9b.aspx[Protecting Connection Information] and also https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms254947.aspx[Connection String Builders].
