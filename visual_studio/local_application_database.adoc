= Local Application Database

.NET has a number of https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms233817(v=vs.110).aspx[built-in, local, file-based database capabilites] similar to using SQLite

* SQL Server Compact database files (.sdf)
* SQL Server Express LocalDB database files (.mdf)
* SQL Server Express database files (.mdf)
* Microsoft Access database files (.mdb)

Use of a local file-based database allows projects to not have to store information related to the code of the local application in the main database. This allows two installations to share the same main database, but to diverse in their configuration in their local databases; and the main database is kept clean, and only contains actual data.
