`vim` has an irregular but annoying display issue when used via `tmux` through `ssh`.  Neovim reportedly does not suffer from the same problem,
therefore I often upgrade.

```
sudo apt-get install neovim
sudo apt-get install python3-neovim
```

Run `:checkhealth provider` to check set up correctly.
