Create an ISO from a disc in Windows by:
> - Run 7-Zip File Manager
> - Open top level folder (by clicking the upfolder button several times, or clear the address bar and hit enter)
> - Open "\\." item
> - Select DVD drive item, press F5 (Copy), and select the folder to write ISO image.

There's no indication that it is going to create an ISO file - but it does.
