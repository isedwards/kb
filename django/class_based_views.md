"Arguments passed to a view are shared between every instance of a view. This means that you shouldnâ€™t use a list, dictionary, or any other mutable object as an argument to a view. If you do and the shared object is modified, the actions of one user visiting your view could have an effect on subsequent users visiting the same view."
