Windows 10 is a different animal to previous releases with Microsoft undertaking more monitoring than ever before, especially in the `Tech Preview`_.

If linux is not already your primary OS, perhaps now is the time.

For some odd reason, Windows 10 switches my wi-fi on and off all day long (even when not on battery...)

Power management options for wi-fi had "Allow the computer to turn off this device to save power" as default, but turning this off did not help.  Updating to the latest drivers did not help, nor did the suggestion of disabling then enabling the Wireless Network Connection, or uninstalling complete (e.g. following this `full list`_). Following `this advice`_ I changeed the wireless adapter's settings from auto to 20 MHz only.

We've changed service provider (and therefore Wi-fi router) without any joy, and I've disabled Bluetooth and WWAN in BIOS (leaving only WLAN).
