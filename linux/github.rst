When viewing a file on GitHub, you can `press the "y" key <https://help.github.com/articles/getting-permanent-links-to-files/>`_ to update the URL to a permalink to the exact version of the file you see (Press "?" on any page in GitHub to see all available keyboard shortcuts).

You can add [images into a GitHub wiki](http://mikehadlow.blogspot.co.uk/2014/03/how-to-add-images-to-github-wiki.html), but only by cloning etc.
