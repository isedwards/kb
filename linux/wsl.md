Late 2018 - Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) still doesn't seem ready for prime time.

- Having trouble with external drives [not being mounted](https://github.com/Microsoft/WSL/issues/1131) in WSL
- Display of tmux status bar gets duplicated up the screen sometimes
- Window's software cannot use WSL applications, e.g. "[PyCharm using WSL's git?](https://intellij-support.jetbrains.com/hc/en-us/community/posts/115000176290-Pycharm-using-WSL-s-git-)" (third-party solutions are suggested, but instead I just install [git for windows](https://github.com/Microsoft/WSL/issues/1131) locally which uses MINGW)
