In had trouble installing the [GRsync](http://www.opbyte.it/grsync/) GUI for rsync on MacOS, so I'm currently using the mac-only [RSyncUI](https://github.com/rsyncOSX/RsyncOSX#install-by-homebrew) instead.

I'm also nterested in [syncthing](https://syncthing.net) - continuous file synchronization for private cloud) backup.
